The address of the dataset I use is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset

The data set is of cropped images of male and female . It is split into training and validation directory. 
Training contains ~23,000 images of each class and test contains ~5,500 images of each class.
(because it did't have the test data,I change the validation to the test data)

I only used the CNN model, but I normalized the data and processed it using Adam optimizer and CSE loss function. 
This model is 80% correct and helps us distinguish between genders in a large number of pictures of people
